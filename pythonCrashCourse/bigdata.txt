The Long Run to Stonegate: A Short Chronicle

The dwarves of Kaldrum measured time by echoes, not sun. When Foreman Braska led nine
explorers into the Deep Roads, he checked the echo-charts and set boots toward a forgotten
spur called Rookline. Among them was Darric, a young runner barely beardling, carrying slate
and lantern. He dreamed of surface skies but now learned the weight of ancient dark.

The expedition found ruins of an old pump-station and the signs of a battle long settled.
Strange stains, scorched runes, and silence deeper than stone. Bevala the warden declared
the place rotten; Penrig the lorekeeper scribbled notes. A smell of iron and brine began to
follow them. Soon the tunnels whispered, then trembled. Skrithe—blind, gnawing
things—swarmed like rivers of teeth. The dwarves fought with salt, oil, hammer, and prayer.
They survived, but not unscathed.

Braska decided to turn back and warn Stonegate. The Deep disagreed. Ceilings collapsed,
bridges moaned, echoes warped. Two were lost to the falling dark. The survivors limped,
carrying wounds like brands. When the way grew too narrow, Braska made the hard choice:
someone must run ahead alone. He turned to Darric, the youngest. 'Stonegate must seal the
gate. Only speed will carry warning.' The boy accepted with a lantern, a rope, salt, and a
note sealed by Braska's hammer-mark.

Darric ran. In the Deep, running is half memory, half instinct: ducking low ceilings,
sliding gravel, counting breaths. He found back-ways whispered of in maps, crossed chain
bridges while naming home aloud, and passed the sick hum of a broken pump. When skrithe
returned, he drew salt-lines with trembling hands, threw ward-ink like thunder. Fear became
rhythm; rhythm carried him forward.

At a basalt bridge, a coin offering still clung to the keystone. Darric pressed his brow to
it, begged 'Hold, please,' and the bridge held. He pushed past shadows shaped like bone and
rope-tricked them into chasing echoes. His lantern sputtered, and he named it 'Old Aunt,'
telling it jokes to keep the flame alive. At last, air thinned, and the scent of iron and
wind promised the Surface.

Stonegate’s wardens found him staggering, note in hand, words rasped: 'Rookline is rotten.'
Gongs sounded, runes flared, the Under-Gate sealed against the rising dark. Relief parties
later found Braska’s crew diminished but alive, survivors etched with dust and sorrow. They
praised the runner who carried warning faster than stone could fall. In halls and alehouses,
the story grew taller, as stories do.

Surface dwarves tell of a youth who outran collapse and tricked the Deep itself. Deep
dwarves tell of rhythm, salt, and wounds endured. Both agree: Stonegate was saved because a
runner carried words when others could not. Darric returned to his hall with legs trembling,
and on his slate he wrote the lesson that mattered most: 'Keep moving, even when bravery
takes the long way round.'
